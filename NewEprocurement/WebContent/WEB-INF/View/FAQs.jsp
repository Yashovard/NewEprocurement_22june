                                                            Using an Electronic Tendering System simplifies many things, step and procedures that are involved in the tendering process. It facilitates all the activities involved from the time of advertising to the time of placing a contract. During that time, physical documents are not used, rather electronic documents are implemented. Since the system uses only electronic documents, it is easy for us to offer our esteemed customers and clients the best solutions to any tendering process that they want to undertake. In order to ensure that the solution is viable and valid, the system uses a time-locking approach when handling multiple biddings. At the same time, it is tamper-proof in order to ensure data integrity and securing the bidding process and payment options. Buyers do not want to use a system that does not have a secure payment option. The reason for such caution lies on the fact that fraudsters might take advantage of week payment options to receive payments. Since tenders usually involve large amounts of money, it is clear that such security flaws should not be present. Lotus Procure has taken into account detailed security measure to prevent any misfortune during making payments. Depending on your needs, you can acquire the licensed or hosted mode of the e-tendering solution.
